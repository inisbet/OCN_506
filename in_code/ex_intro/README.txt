This is code to explore basic python programming techniques, including functions and file I/O.

==========================================================

* test0.py defines a function and prints info to the screen.

==========================================================

* first_python_program.py makes a plot, and shows the typical organization for a python program.

==========================================================

* test_my_module.py shows how to import a module you wrote that may be in a different directory.

==========================================================

* test_input_output.py is about file input/output, especially opening a text file and going through it line by line.

Input: a CTD data file in pmec_data

Output: a short text file in pmec_output

==========================================================

* plot_ctd_data.py is like test_input_output.py above, but it makes plots.  It also demonstrates two approaches to parsing a text file into data arrays, including using pandas.

Input: a CTD data file in pmec_data

Output: screen plots and two .png files in pmec_output
